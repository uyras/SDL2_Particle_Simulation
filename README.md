# Combustion simulation

This is very beginning and fast written code at late Friday night. Don't blame me about quality =).

The visualisation is as follows:

1. 10000 particles are created as square lattice 100*100
2. they start to move in random direction and random speed
3. then we ignite several top left particles
4. it ignites all particles in near small range, and causes chain reaction
5. after several steps the ignited particle goes out.

The video is avaliable here: https://youtu.be/1Hyse3H8cL4.

The visualisation and movement of particles are based on the code of Andrei Vasilev (https://github.com/AndreiVasilev/SDL2_Particle_Simulation). Thanks him for it.
